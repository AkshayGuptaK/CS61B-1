# CS61B
- CS61B is a course on data structures and algorithms using Java. Over the course of the semester, we worked on 4 projects, 1 mini-project (galaxies) and 3 normal projects.
- We were given skeleton code for these projects, but we had to figure out how the functions worked together in order to create the machines and determine what data structures and algorithms to create the most efficient program.
